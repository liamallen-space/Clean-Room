# Clean-Room

A new clean satellite integration clean room was needed upon moving into a new fascility in order to assemble a propulsion system project with a deadline a few months after the move in date. I was involved in all stages of the project being the primary engineer in charge, including tailoring project requirements, design, analysis and validation, procurement, assembly, final commissioning, and ongoing support.
